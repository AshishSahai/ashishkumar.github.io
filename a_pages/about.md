Iâ€™m Ashish Kumar â€” a automation engineer, data analyst and former validation engineer with a story rooted in resilience, reinvention, and self-belief.

With a background in validation engineering and a strong focus on automation and system reliability, Iâ€™ve worked hands-on with QA processes, test automation, and performance validation. Over time, I developed a deep interest in data â€” leading me to independently pursue data analytics and apply those skills across real-world projects.

This journey has been built on consistency, curiosity, and a commitment to mastering both quality engineering and data-driven problem solving.

If you're looking for someone who bridges the gap between test automation and analytical thinking â€” let's connect.

### What I Do

I work with real-world data â€” the kind thatâ€™s messy, incomplete, and full of insight. I use:

- **Python & Pandas** for data cleaning, wrangling, and analysis  
- **Selenium WebDriver** for automating test cases
- **SQL** for querying relational databases and joining insights across tables  
- **Power BI** for building dashboards that drive decisions  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for turning data into visual stories  
- **Scikit-learn** for building and testing machine learning models  

Iâ€™ve built projects in domains like **healthcare**, **sales**, and **automation** â€” and continue to refine my skills through public work on GitHub.

### Why I Do It

Because I know what it feels like to rebuild.  
Because data gives structure to chaos â€” and I find calm in that.  
Because I believe growth is earned, not given.

I approach every dataset like I approach life: patiently, thoroughly, and with full attention.
