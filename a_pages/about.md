I'm Ashish Kumar â€” an SDET with a strong foundation in automation and data analysis, and the founder of A28 AI Lab (registered under the Government of India).

I began my career validating complex systems while also taking initiative to automate testing workflows â€” a habit that eventually shaped my transition into building intelligent, scalable tools. Along the way, I also taught myself data analysis to strengthen my ability to solve real-world problems with logic, structure, and evidence.

At A28 AI Lab, I built products like SkillScope, an AI-powered resume analyzer and job description matcher, and DripDesk, an automation platform for email workflows. These projects involved developing NLP-driven pipelines, designing automation test flows, and deploying production-ready tools â€” all from scratch.

Through every phase â€” from hands-on automation to startup execution â€” Iâ€™ve stayed grounded in curiosity, clarity, and impact. If you're looking for someone who blends QA precision, automation thinking, and analytical depth â€” Iâ€™d be excited to connect.

### What I Do

I work with real-world data â€” the kind thatâ€™s messy, incomplete, and full of insight. I use:

- **Python & Pandas** for data cleaning, wrangling, and analysis  
- **Selenium WebDriver** for automating test cases
- **SQL** for querying relational databases and joining insights across tables  
- **Power BI** for building dashboards that drive decisions  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for turning data into visual stories  
- **Scikit-learn** for building and testing machine learning models  

Iâ€™ve built projects in domains like **healthcare**, **sales**, and **automation** â€” and continue to refine my skills through public work on GitHub.

### Why I Do It

Because I know what it feels like to rebuild.  
Because data gives structure to chaos â€” and I find calm in that.  
Because I believe growth is earned, not given.

I approach every dataset like I approach life: patiently, thoroughly, and with full attention.
