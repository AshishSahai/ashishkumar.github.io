Iâ€™m Ashish Kumar â€” a self-taught data analyst with a story rooted in resilience, reinvention, and self-belief.

After stepping away from my career as a validation engineer, I made the choice to build a new path â€” one grounded in real-world data, problem solving, and consistent learning. The journey hasnâ€™t been easy. Iâ€™ve faced financial strain, family expectations, and personal setbacks. But in all of that, I never stopped showing up.

### What I Do

I work with real-world data â€” the kind thatâ€™s messy, incomplete, and full of insight. I use:

- **Python & Pandas** for data cleaning, wrangling, and analysis  
- **SQL** for querying relational databases and joining insights across tables  
- **Power BI** for building dashboards that drive decisions  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for turning data into visual stories  
- **Scikit-learn** for building and testing machine learning models  

Iâ€™ve built projects in domains like **healthcare**, **sales**, and **automation** â€” and continue to refine my skills through public work on GitHub.

### Why I Do It

Because I know what it feels like to rebuild.  
Because data gives structure to chaos â€” and I find calm in that.  
Because I believe growth is earned, not given.

I approach every dataset like I approach life: patiently, thoroughly, and with full attention.
