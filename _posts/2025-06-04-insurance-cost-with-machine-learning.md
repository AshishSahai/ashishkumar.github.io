A deep dive into how I built a data pipeline to predict medical insurance billing amounts using Python and Decision Tree Regressor.

### 1. Problem Statement
Insurance companies want to estimate billing based on age, BMI, smoker status, etc.

### 2. Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- DecisionTreeRegressor from scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

### 3. Key Highlights
- Cleaned messy, real-world dataset
- Performed EDA and feature engineering
- Applied ML model to predict billing
- Visualized results with accuracy metrics

### 4. Outcome
Smokers tend to be charged significantly more for insurance, especially in higher BMI ranges. Identified BMI and smoker status as key drivers. Children vs Age: People aged between Xâ€“Y tend to have more dependents. Entire project is on [https://github.com/AshishSahai/Insurance-Data-Analysis].

### 5. What I Learned
- ML intuition: overfitting, feature importance
- Model explainability
- Communicating results with non-tech teams
