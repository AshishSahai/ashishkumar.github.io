Breaking into data analytics doesn’t always require a formal degree.  
In my case, it took consistency, project work, and a clear intention to grow.

### From Engineering to Analytics

I started my journey in a technical role as a validation engineer in a robotics-focused firm. Over time, I found myself drawn more toward **data, insights, and automation** than hardware. That curiosity eventually turned into a full-blown commitment to learning analytics.

### Freelancing That Built Real Skills

I began working with a small registered firm — **RIB Investments and Infra Developers** — as a freelance data analyst and technical consultant.

There, I:

- Analyzed customer and business data to **generate qualified leads**
- Built **dashboards and reports** using Power BI, Excel, and SQL
- Automated internal processes using **Python and Pandas**
- Worked directly with leadership to turn raw data into actionable decisions

The experience gave me **real business exposure**, tight deadlines, and the confidence to build solutions from scratch.

### What I Learned Along the Way

While working, I continued learning through self-guided study. My stack now includes:

- **Python, Pandas, NumPy**
- **SQL (certified)**
- **Power BI dashboards**
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for storytelling with data
- **Scikit-learn** for ML models like decision trees and random forests
- **Version control** using Git & GitHub
- **Jupyter & PyCharm** for development workflows

I also explored **machine learning fundamentals** and started working with **CNNs, activation functions**, and optimizers like Adam.

### Final Thought

I’m not from a traditional background — but I’ve delivered real results and grown with every challenge.  
Freelancing gave me a runway to test my skills in the real world, and I’m now focused on full-time opportunities where I can bring that same impact and work ethic.
